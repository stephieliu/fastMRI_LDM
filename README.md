# fastMRI_LDM [Currently Under Development]

This project aims to synthesize complex multi-coil raw brain MRI/k-space data synthesis using a latent diffusion model, trained on the fastMRI dataset.

- "active" contains all of the main code [in progress]
- "archived" contains draft code snippets sourced from various open-source LDM projects that are organized to reference efficiently if needed
- "testing&learning" contains code for testing and debugging subtasks

## Acknowledgements
This project is supervised and was initially proposed by Dr. Mark Chiew, as part of my time as a 2024 summer research student for the Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre.
Thank you to Dr. Chiew and the Chiew Lab group for being incredibly supportive!
